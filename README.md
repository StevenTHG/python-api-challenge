# Python Api Challenge

Included in this repo is are the "VacationPy" and "WeatherPy" folders corresponding to the two tasks of this challenge. The "WeatherPy" contains a Jupyter Notebook labelled "WeatherPy" that uses the OpenWeatherMap Api to gather weather data on the randomly generated cities. This information was then used to create scatter plots to observe the relationship between latitude and max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. The figures generated and the data on these cities were exported into an output folder that would later be used in the second task. The scatter plots were then split between northern and southern hemisphere to further examine these relationships. In the "VacationPy" folder, the included Jupyter Notebook calls on the previously mentioned data on the cities to plot on a geographic map. These cities were then narrowed down based on desired weather conditions and the resulting cities were then used to call on the Geoapify API to generate nearby hotels, which were also mapped geographically.
